## 1. About
**Sngfetch** is a Python app designed to retrieve data about a song by analyzing audio captured through your microphone.  
With Sngfetch, you can:
- Identify a song.
- Fetch song metadata (e.g., title, artist, album).
- Optionally retrieve the song lyrics.

---

## 2. How It Works
Sngfetch utilizes three APIs:
1. **Shazam API**: To identify the song and its metadata.
    > Note: The reverse engineered shazam api is accessed trough [shazamio](https://github.com/shazamio/ShazamIO).
2. **Deezer API**: To provide additional details about the song.
3. **Genius API**: (Optional) To fetch song lyrics.  
   > Note: To use the Genius API, youâ€™ll need to [create a free account](https://docs.genius.com/) and register an application.

## 3. Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following:
- **Python 3.7+**
    > Only if you are running the python file yourself.
- A microphone-enabled device.

### Running
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pyth0g/Sngfetch.git
   cd Sngfetch
   ```
2. Here you can either use a packaged python binary from the **./bin** folder (windows or linux), or you can run the python file:
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv # Create a virtual environment (not always necessary)
    source .venv/bin/activate # Only if you made a virtual environment
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    cd src
    python sngfetch.py -h # Run program and show help screen
    ```

### Packaging
If you wish to package the app yourself:
- Make sure that if you are using a virtual environment your source is in the env, then run:
    ```bash
    pip install pyinstaller
    pyinstaller sngfetch.spec # Run this in the source directory
    ```
    This will create a **dist** folder in which is your executable.
